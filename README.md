AQI PREDICTION USING SARIMA AND XGBOOST
Abstract— Air is one of the most vital element of nature that sustains life on earth and the monitoring , prediction and
analysis of Air quality can be considered as one the great milestones that humans have achieved. The advancements in
Machine learning , Artificial intelligence and other computing technologies have paved way for a huge leap in the overall
analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI). Environment sustainability has been a key issue over many decades and research has
been conducted on multiple fronts over the last two decades. Regular monitoring and analysis has and will always help
scientists in understanding the upcoming threats and work hand in hand with governments and several non governmental
organizations in taking actions and implementing restrictions for a quality future with a good AQI. The simple rule of
prevention is better than cure is the crux of AQI analysis, getting to know the threats beforehand will prepare us to deal
with it better. In the project we will be taking into account the air quality data published by Central Pollution Control Board
Of India. We will be taking the data from 2015-2020 for our analysis and will apply several algorithms to forecast the air
quality of India in coming years and perform a analysis of the data to infer several facts. The project includes all the major
stages of a Data Analytic Pipeline and the detailed exploratory analysis of the data-set.
